											Catalogs of <b> stellar-mass compact binary systems</b> detected by
											ground-based gravitational-wave instruments will offer insights
											into the <b>demographics of progenitor systems and the physics guiding
											stellar evolution</b>. The masses of existing binary black-hole
											detections already imply that the metallicity of their progenitor
											systems must have been sub-solar, and the combination of mass,
											redshift, spin, and rate information from future detections will
											further elucidate the underlying astrophysics. Existing techniques
											approach this through phenomenological models, discrete model
											selection, or model mixtures. Instead, we explore a technique
											that uses gravitational-wave catalogs to directly infer posterior
											probability distributions of progenitor metallicity, kick
											parameters, and common-envelope efficiency. <b>We use a bank of
											compact-binary population synthesis simulations to train a
											Gaussian-process emulator</b> that acts as a prior on observed
											parameter distributions (e.g. chirp mass, redshift, rate).
											This emulator slots into a hierarchical population inference
											framework to <b>extract the underlying astrophysical origins of
											systems detected by LIGO, Virgo, etc</b>. The method is fast,
											easily expanded with additional simulations, and can be
											adapted for training on arbitrary population synthesis codes,
											and <b>detectors like LISA</b>.

														The <b>Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave
														Observatory (aLIGO)</b> has detected five binary black-hole
														(BBH) mergers and one double neutron star (DNS) merger
														since becoming operational in 2015, with <b>Advanced
														Virgo (AdvVirgo)</b> joining the hunt in August 2017.
													</li>

													<li>
														<b>Individual systems can teach us much</b>, such as that BBH
														systems can form and merge within a Hubble time, and
														that their GW emission can be directly detected. We
														also learned that the emitted GW radiation was consistent
														with Einstein's General Relativity Theory. Likewise,
														the detection and electromagnetic follow-up of the DNS
														system (GW170817) showed that NS mergers could explain
														the origin of short gamma-ray bursts, gave insight into
														the equation-of-state of nuclear matter, constrained
														the graviton speed, and gave a measure of the Hubble
														constant.
													</li>

													<li>
														The <b>catalog of BBH mergers</b> span a range of masses,
														distances, component spin-sky-locations, and sky-locations.
														One of the first surprising aspects of these systems
														is how massive they are, with the component BH masses
														in GW150914 being around 30 times as big as the Sun.
													</li>

													<li>
														Attention is now turning to <b>GW population inference</b>,
														where we try to <b>mine the catalog of detections</b> to
														understand typical <b>stellar evolutionary paths</b>,
														<b>progenitor conditions</b>, and the fraction formed
														in the <b>field versus dense stellar clusters</b>.

													<b>Bayesian parameter estimation</b> on a single GW event requires
													a choice of prior probabilities for the
													different intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. The
													<b>prior on parameters</b> such as component
													masses, spin magnitudes/orientation, source redshift, etc.
													should <b>follow from our existing knowledge of the population</b>.
													However, the <b>standard safe-choice
													is for priors to be weak and un-informative</b> (with
													broad ranges), so that the resulting posterior distributions are
													dominanted by data constraints.
												</li>

												<li>
													In <b>hierarchical population inference</b>, we take the posterior
													samples from each event (usually from Markov Chain Monte Carlo
													analysis) and correct for the influence of this interim
													prior choice. This gets us back to the likelihood of each
													event. We can then  <b>multiply all of these likelihoods together</b>,
													and <b>constrain the entire cataloged population with a new prior</b>.
												</li>

												<li>
													This new prior may have its own population parameters,
													which are called <b>hyper-parameters</b>. These hyper-parameters
													can describe things like the shape of the chirp-mass
													distribution, the fraction of systems formed in the field
													versus in dense stellar clusters, the <b>physical processes of
													stellar evolution</b>, or <b>progenitor star conditions</b>.
												</li>

												<li>
													The figure shown here is a <b>probabilistic graphical model</b>
													illustrating the chain of conditional dependencies in
													hierarchical population inference for LIGO. The strain
													data is composed of signal and noise, where we assume
													the noise is Gaussian and characterized by a power
													spectral density. The data will be GW signals for each
													event, with waveforms having <b>physical parameters which
													we constrain with a population prior</b>. This population prior
													constrains "features" in parameter distributions determined
													from principal component analysis. The weights of these
													features (and thus the prior distributions) depend on
													<b>hyper-parameters like progenitor metallicity, BH natal
													kick magnitude, and common-envelope hardening efficiency</b>.

														Our fiducial analysis treats the power spectrum of
															timing deviations caused by a GWB
															as a <b>power law</b>, defined by an amplitude (calibrated to a
															frequency of 1/year) and a spectral index. A GWB from
															a population of supermassive black-hole

													<li>
														We find that <b>upper limits</b> (shown here at 95% credibility) and signal-vs.-noise
															Bayes factors <b>depend strongly</b> on which
															<b>Solar-System Ephemeris</b> (SSE) we adopt. We consider a
															variety of SSEs</a>
															from the <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?ephemerides">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> and <a href="https://www.imcce.fr/inpop/">INPOP </a>;
															 Bayes factors vary by over an order
 															of magnitude (from clear nondetection to promising feature)
 															depending on the SSE. Hence, <b>systematic
 															errors in the SSE can mimic a GW signal</b>.
													</li>

													<li>
														The most influential errors arise from the <b>uncertainties on Jupiter's
															orbit</b>, and from the correlated influence of
															Uranus and Neptune's uncertainties on Jupiter. These
															make it hard to locate the center of the Solar-System
															to the precision and accuracy needed for pulsar-timing
															GW detection.
													</li>

													<li>
														We have developed a scheme (<b>BayesEphem</b>)
															to mitigate these SSE errors, which is described below.

														<li>
															Our scheme starts with a baseline ephemeris; we then construct an <b>11-parameter model that perturbs
															the position of the Solar-System barycenter</b> (SSB).
															The model includes a drift-rate of the Earth's orbit
															about the ecliptic z-axis, mass perturbations of the gas giants,
															as well as linearized corrections to Jupiter's orbital elements
															(e.g., eccentricity, semi-major axis, etc.). These
															corrections are the dominant influence.

																limits and detection statistics</b>, no matter

															Our <b>fiducial GWB amplitude upper limit is 1.45 x 10<sup>&minus;15</sup></b> (when
																inter-pulsar correlations are modeled), and 1.34 x 10<sup>&minus;15</sup> (when they are not, as in previously reported limits). Signal-vs.-noise Bayes factors
