											Catalogs of <b> stellar-mass compact binary systems</b> detected by
											ground-based gravitational-wave instruments (such as
											<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO">LIGO</a> or
											<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_interferometer">Virgo</a>)
											will offer insights
											into the <b>demographics of progenitor systems and the physics guiding
											<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution">stellar evolution</a></b>.
											The masses of existing binary black-hole
											detections already imply that the metallicity of their progenitor
											systems must have been sub-solar, and the combination of mass,
											redshift, spin, and rate information from future detections will
											further elucidate the underlying astrophysics. Existing techniques
											approach this through phenomenological models, discrete model
											selection, or model mixtures. Instead, we explore a technique
											that uses gravitational-wave catalogs to directly infer posterior
											probability distributions of progenitor metallicity, kick
											parameters, and common-envelope efficiency. <b>We use a bank of
											compact-binary population synthesis simulations to train a
											<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process">Gaussian-process</a> emulator</b> that acts as a prior on observed
											parameter distributions (e.g. chirp mass, redshift, rate).
											This emulator slots into a hierarchical population inference
											framework to <b>extract the underlying astrophysical origins of
											systems detected by LIGO, Virgo, etc</b>. The method is fast,
											easily expanded with additional simulations, and can be
											adapted for training on arbitrary population synthesis codes,
											and <b>detectors like
												<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Interferometer_Space_Antenna">LISA</a></b>.

														The <b>Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave
														Observatory (aLIGO)</b> has
														<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gravitational_wave_observationsdetected">five binary black-hole
														(BBH) mergers and one double neutron star (DNS) merger</a>
														since becoming operational in 2015, with <b>Advanced
														Virgo (AdvVirgo)</b> joining the hunt in August 2017.
													</li>

													<li>
														<b>Individual systems can teach us much</b>, such as that BBH
														systems can form and merge within a Hubble time, and
														that their GW emission can be directly detected. We
														also learned that the emitted GW radiation was consistent
														with Einstein's General Relativity Theory. Likewise,
														the detection and electromagnetic follow-up of the DNS
														system (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817">GW170817</a>) showed that NS mergers could explain
														the origin of short gamma-ray bursts, gave insight into
														the equation-of-state of nuclear matter, constrained
														the graviton speed, and gave a measure of the Hubble
														constant.
													</li>

													<li>
														The <b>catalog of BBH mergers</b> span a range of masses,
														distances, component spin-sky-locations, and sky-locations.
														One of the first surprising aspects of these systems
														is how massive they are, with the component BH masses
														in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW150914">GW150914</a> being around 30 times as big as the Sun.
													</li>

													<li>
														Attention is now turning to <b>GW population inference</b>,
														where we try to <b>mine the catalog of detections</b> to
														understand typical <b>stellar evolutionary paths</b>,
														<b>progenitor conditions</b>, and the fraction formed
														in the <b>field versus dense stellar clusters</b>.

													<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference">Bayesian parameter estimation</a></b> on a single GW event requires
													a choice of prior probabilities for the
													different intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. The
													<b>prior on parameters</b> such as component
													masses, spin magnitudes/orientation, source redshift, etc.
													should <b>follow from our existing knowledge of the population</b>.
													However, the <b>standard safe-choice
													is for priors to be weak and un-informative</b> (with
													broad ranges), so that the resulting posterior distributions are
													dominanted by data constraints.
												</li>

												<li>
													In <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_hierarchical_modeling">hierarchical population inference</a></b>, we take the posterior
													samples from each event (usually from <b>Markov Chain Monte Carlo</b>
													analysis) and correct for the influence of this interim
													prior choice. This gets us back to the likelihood of each
													event. We can then  <b>multiply all of these likelihoods together</b>,
													and <b>constrain the entire cataloged population with a new prior</b>.
												</li>

												<li>
													This new prior may have its own population parameters,
													which are called <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter">hyper-parameters</a></b>. These hyper-parameters
													can describe things like the shape of the chirp-mass
													distribution, the fraction of systems formed in the field
													versus in dense stellar clusters, the <b>physical processes of
													stellar evolution</b>, or <b>progenitor star conditions</b>.
												</li>

												<li>
													The figure shown here is a <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model">probabilistic graphical model</a></b>
													illustrating
													hierarchical population inference for LIGO. The
													signals will be gravitational-waveforms for each
													event, with waveforms having <b>physical parameters which
													we constrain with a population prior</b>. This population prior
													constrains "features" in parameter distributions determined
													from principal component analysis. The weights of these
													features (and thus the parameter priors) depend on
													<b>hyper-parameters like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity">progenitor metallicity</a>, BH <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar_kick">natal
													kick</a> magnitude, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_envelope">common-envelope</a> hardening efficiency</b>.

													<li>
														Our approach to hierarchical population inference fuses
														<b>agnostic modeling</b> (i.e. measuring bin-heights
														in histograms of GW parameter distributions) with
														physically-detailed compact-binary <b>population synthesis
														simulations</b>.
													</li>

													<li>
														We design a <b>program of population simulations</b> at <b>different
														points in population hyper-parameter space</b>. Each simulation
														produces a population of compact-binaries; we are interested
														mostly in BBH systems, but this can apply to any population
														or mixture of populations. These <b>synthesized BBH systems
														are filtered for detectability</b> in LIGO-Virgo, which
														will prefer closer and more massive systems.
													</li>

													<li>
														We now have distributions of parameters of detectable
														BBH systems for different progenitor star conditions,
														evolutionary paths, etc. As illustrated here, we can
														<b>interpolate the bin-heights (or pixel intensities) of these
														distributions across
														hyper-parameter space</b>, allowing us to <b>predict new distributions
														without performing more costly simulations</b>. In practice,
														we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">principal-compoennt analysis (PCA)</a> to <b>find characteristic
														"features" in these distributions</b>, then interpolate over these features.
														<b>This drastically reduces the number of interpolants that we need
														to train.</b>
 													</li>

													<li>
														There are various choices of interpolation schemes that
														we could use, e.g. linear, spline, etc. We use <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging">Gaussian
														Process (GP) interpolation</a></b>, which treats the data as a
														single random draw from a multi-variate Gaussian distribution.
														We can use the data to learn the structure of the
														correlation length-scales in hyper-parameter space. This allows
														us to interpolate and extrapolate. Crucially, we also
														gain a measure of the <b>interpolation uncertainty</b>, which we
														can include as additional sources of noise or uncertainty in
														our population analysis.

															90% upper limit of <b>~20% solar metallicity</b>. The figure shows
															the reconstructed intrinsic chirp-mass distribution implied
															by different metallicity constraints.

															For the analysis in <b>Figure 6</b>, we trained our GP interpolants
															using a <b>custom program of 125 simulations</b> across <b>progenitor
															metallicity, BH natal kick magnitude, and common-envelope
															hardening efficiency</b>. Lower metallicity allows stars
															to remain more massive throughout their evolution,
															resulting in more massive BHs. This seems to be needed
															to produce the massive BHs seen in LIGO's current catalog.
